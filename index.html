		The "Flower of Life" can be found in all major religions of
		the world. It contains the patterns of creation as they emerged from the
		"Great Void". Everything is made from the Creator's thought. After the
		creation of the Seed of Life the same vortex's motion was continued,
		creating the next structure known as the Egg of Life. This structure
		forms the basis for music, as the distances between the spheres is
		identical to the distances between the tones and the half tones in
		music. It is also identical to the cellular structure of the third
		embryonic division (The first cell divides into two cells, then to four
		cells then to eight). Thus this same structure as it is further
		developed, creates the human body and all of the energy systems
		including the ones used to create the Merkaba. If we continue creating
		more and more spheres we will end up with the structure called the
		Flower of Life.<a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour" target="_blank"> meer</a>
